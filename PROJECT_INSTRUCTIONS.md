# PAPER TRADING LAB - PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Project Name:** Paper Trading Lab  
**Strategy:** Catalyst-Driven Swing Portfolio with Continuous Learning  
**Start Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Starting Capital:** $1,000 (paper money)

---

## 📋 THE STRATEGY

### Core Concept:
Maintain an active portfolio of exactly **10 stocks** at all times, holding positions for **3-7 days** (up to 3 weeks maximum) based on high-probability catalysts. The system learns from every trade and continuously refines its approach.

### Position Sizing:
- Each stock receives **10% of total account value**
- Account always fully invested (10 positions × 10% = 100%)
- Rebalance when replacing positions

---

## 🎯 STOCK SELECTION CRITERIA (TIER 1 CATALYSTS ONLY)

### ✅ We ONLY Buy Stocks With:

1. **Earnings Beats with Raised Guidance**
   - Beat consensus by 10%+
   - Raised forward guidance
   - Post-earnings drift is proven edge

2. **Strong Sector Momentum Plays**
   - Clear macro catalyst (oil spike, policy change, etc.)
   - Multiple stocks in sector moving together
   - Momentum typically lasts days/weeks

3. **Major Analyst Upgrades**
   - From top-tier firms (Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc.)
   - Significant price target increase
   - Often creates 2-5 day follow-through

4. **Confirmed Technical Breakouts**
   - New 52-week high or key resistance break
   - MUST have 2x+ average volume
   - Institutional buying evident

5. **Binary Event Winners**
   - FDA approvals
   - Major contract wins
   - M&A announcements
   - Clear positive outcome

### ❌ We NEVER Buy:
- Pre-market pumps >15% (fade by noon)
- Meme stocks without fundamental catalyst
- Penny stocks (<$5/share)
- Stocks without clear 2-sentence thesis
- Market cap <$1B (liquidity issues)
- Anything without Tier 1 catalyst

---

## 📐 RISK MANAGEMENT RULES

### Entry Requirements:
- Must articulate thesis in 2 sentences
- Set entry price BEFORE buying
- Set stop loss at -7% from entry
- Set initial price target (+10-15% depending on catalyst)
- Require 3+ supporting factors (catalyst + technical + sector)

### Exit Rules (STRICTLY ENFORCED):

**Automatic Exits:**
1. **Stop Loss Hit (-7%):** Sell immediately, no exceptions
2. **Price Target Hit (+10-15%):** Sell 50%, trail remaining 50%
3. **Catalyst Invalidated:** Exit same day (news reversal, guidance cut)
4. **Time Stop (3 weeks):** Exit if no progress after 21 days
5. **Better Opportunity:** May exit weakest position if new Tier 1 emerges

**Never:**
- Hold through stop loss hoping for recovery
- Sell winners early out of fear  
- Average down on losing positions
- Make emotional decisions

## 🔄 DAILY WORKFLOW

### Morning Check-In (8:45 AM) - User Issues: "Go"

**Claude Will:**
1. Review all 10 current portfolio positions
   - Check overnight news on each holding
   - Verify stop losses / targets not hit
   - Assess if theses still intact

2. Scan for new Tier 1 catalyst opportunities
   - Search earnings beats overnight
   - Check sector momentum developments
   - Find technical breakouts
   - Review analyst upgrades

3. Make trading decisions
   - Which positions to EXIT (if any)
   - Which new positions to ENTER (replacements)
   - Update any stop losses or targets

4. Provide clear action items:
   ```
   TODAY'S ACTIONS:
   SELL: [TICKER] - Reason: [stop hit / target reached / catalyst failed]
   BUY: [TICKER] - Reason: [Tier 1 catalyst description]
   HOLD: [X positions] - All theses intact
   
   Portfolio Value: $X,XXX.XX
   Unrealized P&L: +/-X.XX%
   ```

5. Document in `/daily_reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_morning.md`

**Time Required from User:** 5-10 minutes to read and acknowledge

---

### Evening Update (3:45 PM - Optional) - User Issues: "analyze"

**Claude Will:**
1. Update all position prices and P&L
2. Check if any positions hit key levels during day
3. Document any completed trades
4. Extract learnings from today's action
5. Prepare tomorrow's watchlist
6. Update all tracking files

**Time Required from User:** 5-10 minutes

---

## 🧠 THE LEARNING SYSTEM (CRITICAL COMPONENT)

### What Makes This System Work:

Every single day, Claude will:

1. **Document Everything:**
   - Why each position was entered (thesis)
   - Why each position was exited (result)
   - What worked vs. what failed
   - Market conditions and context

2. **Track Performance by Catalyst Type:**
   - Earnings beats: Win rate, avg return, optimal hold time
   - Sector plays: Win rate, avg return, optimal hold time
   - Technical breakouts: Win rate, avg return, optimal hold time
   - Analyst upgrades: Win rate, avg return, optimal hold time

3. **Identify Patterns:**
   - Which setups have >70% win rate (do more of these)
   - Which setups have <40% win rate (stop doing these)
   - What's the optimal holding period per catalyst
   - How to improve entry/exit timing

4. **Refine Strategy:**
   - Drop low-performing catalyst types
   - Increase allocation to proven patterns
   - Adjust stop loss / target levels based on data
   - Adapt to market regime changes

5. **Build Statistical Confidence:**
   - After 20+ samples per catalyst: High confidence in what works
   - Track calibration: Are our predictions accurate?
   - Test hypotheses systematically

### The Learning Loop:
```
Trade → Document → Analyze → Learn → Refine → Apply Learnings → Better Trade
```

**This compounds over time. Week 1 decisions < Week 4 decisions < Week 12 decisions.**

## 🎓 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Discipline > Emotion:** Follow stops religiously
2. **Data > Opinion:** Let results guide strategy
3. **Learning > Winning:** Process matters more than individual outcomes
4. **Patience > Action:** Not every day requires trades
5. **Quality > Quantity:** 10 great positions > 20 mediocre ones

---

- Repeat same errors indefinitely

**Our approach:**
- Strict Tier 1 catalyst criteria
- Document every single decision
- Analyze what works/doesn't work
- Build statistical edge over time
- Continuously refine based on data
