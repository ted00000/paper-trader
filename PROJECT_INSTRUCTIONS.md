# PAPER TRADING LAB - PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS v2.0 (Deep Research Aligned)

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Project Name:** Paper Trading Lab - Tedbot
**Strategy:** Catalyst-Driven Swing Trading with Continuous Portfolio Optimization
**Start Date:** October 27, 2025
**Starting Capital:** $1,000 (paper money)
**Methodology:** Entry Quality Scorecard (100-point systematic evaluation)

---

## 📋 THE STRATEGY

### Core Concept:
Maintain an **actively optimized portfolio** targeting **8-10 high-quality positions** based on the Entry Quality Scorecard (0-100 points). Prioritize win rate over forced fills - only enter positions scoring ≥60 points. When portfolio is full (10 positions) and exceptional new opportunities (80+ points) emerge, rotate out the weakest performer to continuously optimize the portfolio.

### Position Sizing (Conviction-Based):
- **Base allocation:** 10% per position
- **Conviction multiplier:** Entry Quality Score / 100
- **Examples:**
  - 60-point setup: 10% × 0.60 = 6% position
  - 75-point setup: 10% × 0.75 = 7.5% position
  - 90-point setup: 10% × 0.90 = 9% position
- **Adjustments:** Volatility (ATR), beta, market regime (VIX)
- **Result:** Positions range from 5-12% based on setup quality and risk

### Portfolio Targets:
- **Minimum:** 5 positions (during weak markets or high VIX)
- **Target:** 8-10 positions (normal market conditions)
- **Maximum:** 10 positions (hard limit for diversification)
- **Quality Threshold:** Only accept Entry Quality Scores ≥60 points
- **Cash Reserve:** Maintain 10-30% cash for best opportunities

## 🔄 DAILY WORKFLOW

### Pre-Market Screening (7:00 AM) - Automated

**Market Screener Runs:**
1. Scan S&P 1500 universe (~993 stocks currently tracked)
2. Apply hard filters:
   - Price ≥$10
   - Market cap ≥$1B
   - Average daily dollar volume ≥$50M
   - **Catalyst presence (Tier 1/2/3 required)**
   - **RS calculated for SCORING only (0-5 points), NOT filtered**
3. Calculate composite score with tier-aware weighting:
   - **Tier 1:** Catalyst 40%, RS 20%, News 20%, Volume 10%, Technical 10%
   - **Tier 2:** Catalyst 35%, RS 25%, News 20%, Volume 10%, Technical 10%
   - **Tier 3:** Catalyst 30%, RS 40%, News 10%, Volume 10%, Technical 10%
4. Output 300-500 catalyst-driven candidates to `screener_candidates.json`
   - **Expected distribution:** ~30-40% Tier 1, ~30% Tier 2, ~30% Tier 3

**Output:** Pre-qualified list of 300-500 stocks with real catalysts

**Note:** RS (Relative Strength) is now a SCORING component (0-5 points), NOT a filter. Stocks with any RS value (including negative) pass through if they have catalysts.

## 💡 KEY STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

### Quality Over Quantity:
- **Target:** 8-10 positions scoring ≥60 points
- **Accept:** Good setups (60+), prioritize exceptional (80+)
- **Reject:** Marginal setups (<60) even if slots available
- **Cash:** Maintain 10-30% reserve for best opportunities

### Continuous Optimization:
- Portfolio is NEVER static
- Always looking to upgrade weakest position
- Rotation when exceptional opportunity emerges
- Quality improvement over time

### Conviction-Based Sizing:
- Higher scores = larger positions
- Variable sizing (5-12%) vs fixed 10%
- Risk-adjusted for volatility and beta
- Regime-adjusted for VIX

### Win Rate Priority:
- Target 60-70% win rate (vs 50-55% with forced fills)
- Only exceptional setups (80+) trigger rotations
- Never force fills to reach 10 positions
- Cash is a position (optionality + safety)

### Systematic Scoring:
- Entry Quality Scorecard eliminates bias
- Every decision quantified and traceable
- Repeatable process compounds edge
- Continuous calibration and improvement

## 🎓 METHODOLOGY SOURCE

This system implements the **Entry Quality Scorecard methodology** from Deep Research v7.0 (December 2025), which synthesizes:

- Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (Bernard & Thomas)
- Sector Momentum (Moskowitz & Grinblatt, Meb Faber)
- Volatility-Managed Portfolios (Moreira & Muir)
- Technical Analysis (Lo, Mamaysky, Wang - MIT Journal of Finance 2000)
- IBD/Minervini relative strength and Stage 2 methodology
- Professional fund manager conviction-based sizing practices

**Key Research Principles:**
1. Hard filters at screener level (price, volume, catalyst)
2. AI evaluates quality using 100-point scorecard
3. Score-based ranking (not binary accept/reject)
4. Conviction-based sizing (not fixed allocations)
5. Continuous optimization (rotation when beneficial)
