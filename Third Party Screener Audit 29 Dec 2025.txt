Here’s my independent audit of the Dec 29, 2025 screener (the function that feeds Claude pre-screened candidates), plus where I validate / invalidate Claude’s screener audit.
Screener grade (vs best-in-class)
Score: 6.3 / 10
Why not higher: the screener is clearly functional and finds “something,” but it’s currently letting a huge amount of low-quality noise through (especially via sector rotation), and it appears to violate its own stated hard-filter specs (price floor in particular). That’s exactly the behavior you described (“lots of low quality stocks”).

What the screener produced on Dec 29 (what matters)
	•	148 total candidates, universe 993 stocks, breadth 53.4% (healthy) market screener 29 dec 2025
	•	Candidate distribution:
	◦	Tier 2: 2
	◦	Tier 3 (sector rotation / Healthcare): 127
	◦	Tier 4 (52W breakouts): 19 market screener 29 dec 2025
	•	The output is dominated by Tier 3 “Healthcare +8.5% vs SPY” market screener 29 dec 2025
This is the core mechanical reason you’re seeing “low quality”: the screener is effectively saying “Healthcare is leading → most Healthcare names qualify.”

Validating Claude’s audit (what Claude got right)
1) Sector rotation is too broad and is creating junk candidates — VALID
Claude’s audit says sector rotation is acting like a “free pass” and flooding the candidate set (127 names). That’s consistent with the tier breakdown and the sector rotation logic shown: sector rotation triggers when a sector is +5% vs SPY (moderate) or +10% (strong).
screener audit 29 dec 2025
Also, Claude’s claim that “many have negative RS and no other catalyst” is consistent with the critique that the sector rotation check doesn’t require individual-stock strength before qualifying.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
My conclusion: This is your #1 quality leak.
2) Tier assignment logic allows Tier 3/4 as standalone “primary catalysts” — VALID
The tier assignment excerpt shows a waterfall where Tier 3 (insider/sector rotation) or Tier 4 (breakout/gap-up) becomes the stock’s catalyst tier even if there is no Tier 1/2 catalyst.
market screener 29 dec 2025
If your platform goal/spec is “Tier 1 or Tier 2 required,” then yes—this implementation violates it by design.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
3) “HARD FILTERS” vs what passes — VALID
Claude’s audit points out hard filters like Price > $10 and Liquidity > $50M (as stated in the overview).
screener audit 29 dec 2025
And your own screener output shows candidates with prices well below $10:
	•	AP at $4.65
	•	CCO at $2.25 screener audit 29 dec 2025
That’s a concrete contradiction between stated “hard filter” philosophy and what’s actually being emitted.

Where I disagree or would refine Claude’s conclusions
A) “Remove scoring logic; screener should be dumb” — PARTIALLY VALID, but risky if taken literally
Claude recommends stripping scoring and relying on hard filters only.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
My take:
	•	Agree with the spirit: you currently have “double selectivity” (screener scoring + Claude scoring), and the screener’s extra logic is not preventing the worst pollution (Tier 3 flood).
	•	But best-in-class systems usually still do lightweight quality gating in the screener to protect downstream evaluation (token costs, latency, attention). The “right” approach is:
	◦	Keep screener fast and rule-based
	◦	Add 2–4 surgical gates that remove obvious garbage
	◦	Let Claude do the nuanced scoring/ranking
So: don’t aim for “dumb”; aim for “cheap but decisive.”
B) “Tier 4 breakouts are fine as standalone catalysts” — VALID only if you explicitly choose that philosophy
Claude suggests allowing Tier 4 breakouts if the composite score is strong.
market screener 29 dec 2025
This is a strategy decision, not just an engineering decision:
	•	If Tedbot is truly catalyst-first, then Tier 4 should be supporting, not primary.
	•	If Tedbot is catalyst + elite technicals, then strong Tier 4 breakouts can be primary but must be gated tightly (price/liquidity, volatility sanity, “freshness,” volume quality, and ideally market regime alignment).
Right now, Tier 4 doesn’t look like the main source of junk—Tier 3 is—so I’d treat Tier 4 as “keep, but formalize the rules.”

My key inconsistencies / contradictions I see (actionable)
1) Price hard-filter contradiction (spec vs output)
	•	Spec claims Price > $10 screener audit 29 dec 2025
	•	Output includes $2.25 and $4.65 names screener audit 29 dec 2025
This alone will generate “low quality” behavior because sub-$10 names are disproportionately noisy, manipulated, or structurally different.
2) “Tier 1/2 required” contradiction (spec vs tiering behavior)
	•	Spec claim (as quoted in the audit): “Catalyst presence required (Tier 1 or Tier 2)” screener audit 29 dec 2025
	•	Tier waterfall explicitly assigns Tier 3 or Tier 4 even without Tier 1/2 market screener 29 dec 2025
You need to decide which is truth:
	•	(A) Strict catalyst-only: Tier 1/2 required → Tier 3/4 can only boost a Tier 1/2 candidate
	•	(B) Hybrid: Tier 4 can be primary when extremely strong; Tier 3 cannot be primary
3) Sector rotation treated as sufficient, not supporting
Sector rotation logic meets the threshold spec (>5% vs SPY), but it’s being used in a way that produces mass false positives.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
This is less a “bug” and more a “missing gating rule.”

What I would change first (highest ROI fixes)
These are intentionally minimal changes that will dramatically improve candidate quality without rewriting the system.
Fix 1 — Enforce Price > $10 (and/or your chosen floor) as a true hard gate
This is non-negotiable if you want “best-in-class swing.” Your own output shows why.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
Fix 2 — Kill Tier 3 as a standalone qualifier
Keep sector rotation as supporting evidence only (a bonus), not a primary catalyst. Claude suggested this as an option; I strongly agree.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
Fix 3 — Add individual stock strength requirement before sector rotation can contribute
If you insist on keeping Tier 3 qualifying at all, require something like:
	•	RS positive and meaningful (e.g., RS% > +5), or
	•	price > 50/150/200 MA alignment, etc.
Claude’s “Option B” is directionally correct.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
Fix 4 — Decide your Tier 4 philosophy and encode it cleanly
If Tier 4 is allowed, gate it hard (freshness + volume quality + price/liquidity). Claude’s “composite score >= 50” idea is a reasonable proxy.
market screener 29 dec 2025

Bottom line
	•	Claude’s screener audit is mostly correct, especially on sector rotation flooding, tier waterfall pollution, and spec misalignment. screener audit 29 dec 2025
	•	The clearest “smoking gun” contradiction is Price > $10 vs candidates at $2–$5. screener audit 29 dec 2025
	•	Your fastest path to “best-in-class” candidate quality is:
	1	enforce price/liquidity,
	2	make Tier 3 non-qualifying (support-only),
	3	optionally allow Tier 4 with strong gating.

Grades (1–10 vs best-in-class)
Overall platform (based on what’s in the provided screener artifacts + your stated architecture)
7.8 / 10You’ve got a serious architecture and risk/governance mindset, but the current screener output quality is dragging the whole system down because it pollutes Claude’s decision context and creates “false opportunity density.”
Screener specifically (the focus today)
5.4 / 10Reason: it’s currently letting a huge amount of low-signal, “sector is hot” names through as if they’re legitimate swing candidates, which undermines the platform goal of best-in-class candidate quality.

What I validated in Claude’s screener audit (I agree)
1) Sector-rotation is overwhelming the candidate set (the main culprit)
Claude’s audit says the screener produced 148 candidates and that 127/148 (~86%) are “Tier 3 sector rotation only,” i.e., low-quality names that Claude will likely reject. That diagnosis matches the output breakdown shown in the screener artifacts.
market screener 29 dec 2025
And the root cause is visible: Healthcare is tagged as strongly leading (XLV +8.51% vs SPY) in the screener output, which is exactly the kind of condition that can accidentally “spray” a whole sector if the logic is permissive.
market screener 29 dec 2025
Verdict: ✅ Valid. This is consistent with your lived observation: “identifying a lot of low quality stocks.”

2) Misalignment risk: “Tier 1/2 required” vs Tier 3/4 allowed
Claude flags a spec drift: your overview/architecture wants Tier 1/2 presence as a requirement, but the screener is still passing Tier 3/4-like candidates downstream.
market screener 29 dec 2025
Verdict: ✅ Valid as an architectural mismatch — even if you philosophically want regime-aware tiers, your screener should not default to flooding Claude with Tier 3 “sector is leading” names.

3) Composite scoring creates misleading confidence
Claude’s point: scores in the 40–68 range look “OK,” but are not reliably correlated with true catalyst strength, so they create false confidence and wasted review bandwidth.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
Verdict: ✅ Valid. If Tier 3 names can land in the same score band as real setups, the score is not doing its job.

Where I partly invalidate or tighten Claude’s audit
A) “Remove scoring entirely” — directionally right, but too absolute
I agree the screener is doing too much and still passing junk. But “no scoring at all” isn’t necessarily best-in-class.
Best-in-class pattern:
	•	Hard filters (quality gates) first
	•	Lightweight ranking second (to cap output size + prioritize)
	•	Then Claude does deep, expensive evaluation on a small, high-quality set.
So: ✅ simplify scoring, ✅ add hard gates, ✅ cap the funnel — but I would not automatically delete all ranking unless you have another mechanism to keep outputs stable and small.

B) Token-cost estimate is plausible but not dependable as stated
Claude estimates tokens per candidate and annualized costs.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
That may be roughly directionally true, but the actual waste depends heavily on:
	•	what you include per ticker (news blobs, indicators, history)
	•	your Claude prompt verbosity
	•	whether Claude is required to “explain” every rejection
So: ✅ waste is real; ❓ the exact dollar math is uncertain.

My independent audit: why low-quality stocks are getting through
1) The screener is treating “sector leadership” like a primary catalyst
If “Healthcare leading vs SPY” is enough to trigger a catalyst classification broadly, you’ll naturally get many slow, mega-cap, low-volatility, or “no event” names coming through simply because they’re in the right bucket. That’s consistent with the output showing sector performance data prominently and the audit’s “pollution” metric focus.
market screener 29 dec 2025
market screener 29 dec 2025
Best-in-class expectation: sector strength is a context modifier, not a reason to trade by itself.

2) The funnel lacks a precision governor (a hard cap + minimum bar)
Even if you allow Tier 4 breakouts or Tier 3 rotation as “supporting,” a best-in-class screener still imposes at least one of:
	•	strict “must-have” catalyst types, OR
	•	minimum “event evidence” threshold, OR
	•	output cap (e.g., top 25 only), OR
	•	“quality score must exceed X” + “Tier 3 must exceed Y”
Right now, the system can output 148 candidates in one scan.
market screener 29 dec 2025
That’s not inherently wrong, but it’s incompatible with “best-in-class swing system” if the downstream evaluator is forced to wade through mostly low-signal names.

3) Your screener output shows min_price is enforced, but RS gating looks loosened
In the output, min_price is 10.0 and min_market_cap is 1B, which is good hygiene.
market screener 29 dec 2025
But min_rs_pct shows as null, suggesting RS might not be acting as a real hard gate on this run.
market screener 29 dec 2025
If RS isn’t a hard gate, sector rotation becomes even more dominant, which matches the observed “lots of low quality.”

Concrete fixes (in priority order)
Priority 1 — Stop the “sector rotation spray”
Implement Claude’s recommendation: sector rotation can only add points if Tier 1/2 already exists, not create a candidate on its own.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
This single change likely removes the bulk of the 127 junk names immediately.
market screener 29 dec 2025
My stricter version (best-in-class):
	•	Sector rotation = multiplier, not additive
	•	Example: if Tier 1/2 present, multiply candidate priority by 1.1–1.25 depending on strengthThis prevents “sector context” from overpowering “stock-specific edge.”

Priority 2 — Add an explicit “precision governor”
Pick one (or stack two):
Option A (simple + powerful): Hard cap output
	•	e.g., only pass top 25–40 names after filters.
Option B: Tier-specific thresholds
	•	Tier 1/2: pass if score ≥ X
	•	Tier 4: pass if score ≥ higher X and has breakout confirmation
	•	Tier 3: never passes alone (only as a booster)
Claude suggests variants of this, including rejecting Tier 3 outright or requiring Tier 4 composite > 50.
screener audit 29 dec 2025

Priority 3 — Reintroduce RS as a real hard filter (if it’s currently loosened)
Given the output shows min_rs_pct: null, confirm RS is actually gating.
market screener 29 dec 2025
Best-in-class swing systems usually require some combination of:
	•	RS vs SPY over 3–6 months above a threshold
	•	price above key moving averages (trend confirmation)
	•	liquidity/float constraints to avoid junky movers
Even modest RS gating will dramatically reduce “meh” candidates that only look good because their sector is leading.

Priority 4 — Right-size scoring complexity
I agree with Claude that 3k+ lines of scoring logic can be technical debt if it’s not reliably predictive.
screener audit 29 dec 2025
But don’t go from “too complex” to “none.” Best-in-class is usually:
	•	hard filters (objective, stable)
	•	light ranking (fast, interpretable)
	•	Claude deep evaluation (expensive, flexible)

A quick “definition of done” for the screener (quality metrics)
Use Claude’s metrics as your baseline, but tighten them:
	•	Catalyst authenticity: % of candidates with Tier 1/2 evidence should be near 100% if that’s your architecture goal market screener 29 dec 2025
	•	Sector rotation pollution: should drop from ~127/day to near 0 as a standalone reason market screener 29 dec 2025
	•	Output size: should be stable (e.g., 10–40), not 148 market screener 29 dec 2025
	•	Claude acceptance rate: should rise materially after the change (even if it’s still selective)

Bottom line
Claude’s audit is pointing at the right fire: sector rotation is being treated as a primary catalyst and is flooding the funnel.
market screener 29 dec 2025
I agree with that, and I’d fix it first, then add a precision governor (cap + tier thresholds), and confirm RS gating is truly enforced (since the output suggests it may not be).
market screener 29 dec 2025
If you want, I can propose a “best-in-class hard filter set” (exact gates + ordering) that keeps your regime-aware philosophy without letting Tier 3 swamp the system.
