This is a good question, and the fact that you went from “148 junk names” → “1 name” tells me two things immediately:
	1	You successfully fixed the noise problem, and
	2	You likely overshot on strictness, especially given the calendar
I’ll break this into three parts:
	1	Is returning 1 stock a bug or a market-timing effect?
	2	What in the updated screener mechanically explains this outcome?
	3	What I would change (minimally) to restore balance without re-introducing junk
I’m basing this on a full read of market screener 30 dec 25.txt
market screener 30 dec 25
.

1️⃣ Is “1 stock returned” a problem?
Short answer
No — not automatically.Given Dec 30 + holiday conditions, this outcome is plausible, but only if it is rare and explainable.
Long answer
For a best-in-class swing system, the screener should:
	•	Sometimes return 0–3 names in thin, low-news periods
	•	Sometimes return 10–30 names in active tape
	•	Never force output just to “have something”
So the key question is not “is 1 too few?”It’s:
Is the funnel now behaving consistently with its stated philosophy?
In this case, the answer is mostly yes, with two tuning issues I’ll outline.

2️⃣ Why this screener only returned one stock (mechanically)
This result is not random. It is the compound effect of multiple correct but interacting constraints, amplified by holiday timing.
A. Holiday effect (REAL, not theoretical)
On Dec 30:
	•	Very few earnings beats (Tier 1)
	•	Almost no fresh M&A / FDA (Tier 1)
	•	Low institutional participation
	•	Many stocks fail freshness checks
This matters because you now require genuine, fresh catalysts — which is correct.

B. Your freshness logic is now extremely strict (by design)
You added 48-hour freshness hard gates in multiple places:
	•	Gap-ups market screener 30 dec 25
	•	Volume analysis market screener 30 dec 25
	•	Technical setup (52-week proximity) market screener 30 dec 25
	•	Breakouts market screener 30 dec 25
This line appears repeatedly:
if hours_since_last_trade > 48: reject
This is correct logic, but during:
	•	long weekends
	•	holidays
	•	thin tape
…it becomes multiplicative rejection, not additive filtering.
Net effect:A stock can be:
	•	fundamentally great
	•	technically strong…but rejected because its last “meaningful” bar is 3–4 calendar days old
That’s expected on Dec 30.

C. You effectively removed Tier 3 as a primary path (good)
Your earlier problem — sector-rotation flooding — is now gone.
Sector rotation:
	•	No longer auto-qualifies
	•	No longer sprays Healthcare names
	•	Acts as context only
That alone probably removed 100+ candidates, which is good.

D. Tier 4 (breakouts/gaps) is now extremely selective
You fixed real bugs here (good fixes), but the resulting criteria stack is very tight:
A Tier 4 candidate must now satisfy:
	•	Fresh data (<48h)
	•	True 52-week high
	•	Occurred within last 5 days
	•	Volume ≥150%
	•	Price still within 3% of high
During a holiday week, almost nothing meets all of that.
This is not a bug — it’s calendar sensitivity.

3️⃣ So… bug or timing?
My judgment:
This is primarily timing + compounding strictness, not a broken file.
However…
There is one architectural issue you should address now, or you will see frequent “0–1 candidate” days even in normal markets.

4️⃣ The real issue: compounding hard gates across layers
Right now, you have:
	•	Freshness hard gates
	•	Catalyst hard gates
	•	Volume hard gates
	•	Breakout maintenance hard gates
All of them are reasonable individually.
But best-in-class systems rarely make every layer hard.
What’s happening
A stock can fail any one of:
	•	news freshness
	•	bar freshness
	•	volume confirmation
	•	breakout maintenance
…and get rejected before Claude ever sees it.
That’s why you got 1 name.

5️⃣ What I would change (minimal, high-signal fixes)
🔧 Fix #1 — Introduce ONE “soft freshness” escape hatch
Right now, freshness is binary everywhere.
I would change exactly one place:
If a stock has a Tier 1 catalyst, allow 72–96h freshnessElse keep 48h
Why:
	•	Tier 1 catalysts persist across holidays
	•	Institutions don’t stop caring because of Christmas
	•	This restores realism without re-opening junk

🔧 Fix #2 — Make Tier 4 “maintenance” a score penalty, not a hard reject
Instead of:
“>3% from high = reject”
Change to:
	•	≤3% → full score
	•	3–6% → partial score
	•	6% → reject
This prevents near-perfect setups from being thrown out due to normal digestion.

🔧 Fix #3 — Accept that 1–3 candidates on holidays is OK (but log it)
This is more operational than code:
	•	Log: “LOW OPPORTUNITY DAY – HOLIDAY / THIN TAPE”
	•	Do not force output
	•	Let Claude see why the funnel is tight
Best desks do this.

6️⃣ Final verdict
Screener quality (post-fix)
7.6 / 10⬆️ Up materially from the prior 5.x score
About the “1 stock” result
	•	❌ Not a bug
	•	❌ Not overfitting
	•	✅ Mostly calendar + correct tightening
	•	⚠️ Slight over-strictness via compounded hard gates
If this happens:
	•	Occasionally (holidays, low news): GOOD
	•	Frequently in normal weeks: TOO STRICT
