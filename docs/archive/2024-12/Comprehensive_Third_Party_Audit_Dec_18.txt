Overall Grade vs Best-in-Class Swing Trading Quant Platform
8.2 / 10
That score assumes comparison against top-tier discretionary-quant swing systems, not HFT or stat-arb funds.
You are well above “retail quant”, clearly below institutional multi-PM pods — but closer to the latter than the former.

Where You Are Truly Best-in-Class
1. Strategy–Code–Prompt Alignment (Very Strong)
This is the single biggest improvement after reviewing the Agent file.
What’s excellent:
	•	The Agent enforces rules independently of the LLM
	•	Claude is used for judgment and synthesis, not authority
	•	Hard constraints live in Python (filters, exits, concentration, timing)
	•	Soft reasoning lives in the prompt (thesis, catalyst logic, rotation)
This is exactly how professional discretionary-quant hybrids are built.
Grade: 9.2 / 10

2. Risk Governance & Drift Prevention (Elite)
Very few independent systems do this correctly.
You have:
	•	SYSTEM_VERSION
	•	RULESET_VERSION (hash of prompts + rules + exclusions)
	•	UNIVERSE_VERSION (hash of tradable universe)
	•	Per-trade logging of all three
This allows post-hoc attribution:
“Did performance change because the strategy changed, or because the market did?”
That is institutional-grade hygiene.
Grade: 9.5 / 10

3. Swing-Appropriate Time Semantics (Excellent)
You correctly handle:
	•	15-minute delayed data reality
	•	GO (8:45) → EXECUTE (9:45) → ANALYZE (4:30–4:50)
	•	Premarket gap classification (exhaustion vs continuation)
	•	Minimum hold enforcement
	•	No daily churn
This avoids the #1 failure mode of swing bots: implicit intraday trading by accident.
Grade: 9.0 / 10

4. Catalyst + Technical Fusion (Very Strong)
Your layering is sound:
	1	Universe → Screener
	2	Catalyst validation (news + age + tier)
	3	Market regime (VIX + macro blackout)
	4	Technical filters (hard gates)
	5	Conviction scoring (soft sizing)
	6	Portfolio constraints (sector / industry)
	7	Entry timing refinement
This is how human swing traders actually think, translated correctly into code.
Grade: 8.8 / 10

Key Inconsistencies & Contradictions (Important)
These are not fatal, but they do cap your ceiling.

⚠️ 1. Tier-1-Only Language vs Actual Logic
The contradiction
Your GO prompt and ruleset repeatedly state:
“Tier 1 ONLY — non-negotiable”
However, the Agent still contains full logic paths for Tier 2 and Tier 3:
	•	get_dynamic_profit_target() supports Tier 2 / 3
	•	detect_post_earnings_drift() allows long-duration holds
	•	Conviction logic historically referenced Tier 2 inclusion
	•	CSV schema tracks Tier 2/3 fields
Why this matters
This creates cognitive dissonance:
	•	The system claims exclusivity
	•	The code supports flexibility
This is not a bug — but it weakens experimental clarity.
Recommendation
Pick one:
	•	Hard Mode: Truly Tier-1 only → remove Tier 2/3 pathways
	•	Research Mode: Rephrase prompt to:“Tier 1 preferred; Tier 2 permitted only under explicit conditions”
Right now you’re straddling both.

⚠️ 2. ATR Stops Exist — But Are Not Primary
You implemented:
	•	calculate_atr()
	•	ATR-aware commentary
	•	Stop-percentage tracking
Yet:
	•	Core exits still default to fixed −7%
	•	ATR is not consistently binding stop placement
Why this matters
Best-in-class swing systems:
	•	Normalize risk by volatility
	•	Avoid systematically stopping out high-ATR leaders
Recommendation
Promote ATR to:
	•	Primary stop selector OR
	•	Tier-based modifier (e.g., Tier-1 = wider ATR multiple)

⚠️ 3. Stage-2 Logic Exists but Isn’t Enforced
You implemented a proper Minervini Stage-2 check:
	•	150/200 MA alignment
	•	Trend slope
	•	52-week high proximity
But:
	•	It is not a mandatory gate
	•	Technical filters can pass while Stage-2 fails
Recommendation
Decide:
	•	Either Stage-2 is informational → label it so
	•	Or enforce it as a Tier-1 prerequisite
Right now it sits in an ambiguous middle ground.

⚠️ 4. Learning System Is Diagnostic, Not Adaptive (Yet)
Your learn phase:
	•	Analyzes outcomes
	•	Produces recommendations
	•	Flags inconsistencies
But:
	•	It does not auto-adjust thresholds
	•	It does not re-weight scores
	•	It does not gate future trades
This is fine — but it means learning is human-in-the-loop, not closed-loop.
Best-in-class would at least:
	•	Auto-tighten filters when regimes degrade
	•	Disable underperforming catalyst types temporarily

Where You Are NOT Best-in-Class (Yet)
These are stretch goals, not criticisms:
Area
Why
Portfolio optimization
No correlation-aware sizing or beta targeting
Factor attribution
No formal decomposition of returns
Regime switching
VIX only, no breadth / trend regime
Capital efficiency
Single-bucket sizing, no Kelly-like logic
True automation
Human still approves conceptual shifts

Bottom Line (Plain English)
This is not a toy.It is a serious discretionary-quant swing platform with:
	•	Excellent guardrails
	•	Thoughtful timing realism
	•	Proper separation of judgment vs enforcement
	•	Rarely seen governance discipline
Your biggest opportunity now is decisiveness:
	•	Decide which rules are absolute
	•	Decide which intelligence is advisory
	•	Decide how much autonomy learning should have
If you want, next steps could be:
	•	A “v8 institutional hardening roadmap”
	•	A comparison vs a known hedge-fund swing framework
	•	Or a simulation audit checklist before going live with capital
Just say the word.
