## üîÑ HOW THE COMPLETE SYSTEM WORKS

### MORNING (8:45 AM) - TRADING DECISIONS

```
1. Agent loads context:
   - strategy_rules.md (auto-updated by learning)
   - catalyst_exclusions.json (forbidden patterns)
   - current_portfolio.json
   - recent lessons_learned.md

2. Agent calls Claude API:
   - "Pick 10 stocks following the strategy"
   - Claude sees exclusions and warnings
   - Claude makes informed decisions

3. Agent validates picks:
   - Checks if any picks use excluded catalysts
   - Warns if violations detected
   - Saves decisions to daily_reviews/

4. Trades execute (manual for now, auto in v3)
```

### EVENING (4:30 PM) - PERFORMANCE UPDATE

```
1. Agent loads portfolio:
   - Updates prices
   - Calculates P&L
   - Identifies closed positions

2. Agent calls Claude API:
   - "Update performance and close positions"
   - Claude analyzes results

3. **CRITICAL: CSV Logging**
   - All closed trades written to completed_trades.csv
   - With full details: catalyst, return, hold time, etc.
   - This feeds the learning engines

4. Updates JSON files:
   - account_status.json
   - current_portfolio.json
```

### DAILY LEARNING (5:00 PM) - TACTICAL

```
1. Loads completed_trades.csv

2. Analyzes recent performance (last 7 days):
   - Identifies catalysts losing consistently
   - Flags concerning recent trends

3. Analyzes all-time performance:
   - Calculates win rates by catalyst
   - Determines statistical confidence

4. **AUTO-EXCLUDES LOSERS**:
   - If catalyst has Medium/High confidence
   - AND win rate <35%
   - THEN adds to catalyst_exclusions.json

5. **AUTO-UPDATES STRATEGY**:
   - Modifies strategy_rules.md
   - Adds exclusion section
   - Tomorrow's trades won't use these catalysts

6. Documents in lessons_learned.md
```

### WEEKLY LEARNING (Sunday 6:00 PM) - STRATEGIC

```
1. Deep catalyst analysis:
   - Performance metrics by type
   - Optimal hold times per catalyst
   - Best/worst trades analysis

2. Parameter optimization:
   - Calculates optimal stop loss (data-driven)
   - Calculates optimal profit targets
   - Risk/reward ratios

3. Entry timing analysis:
   - Performance by day of week
   - Identifies timing patterns

4. Updates catalyst_performance.csv

5. Comprehensive insights to lessons_learned.md
```

### MONTHLY LEARNING (Last Sunday 7:00 PM) - MACRO

```
1. Market regime detection:
   - Bull/Bear/Sideways classification
   - Saves to market_regime.json

2. Monthly statistics:
   - Win rate trends
   - Volatility analysis
   - Max drawdown calculation
   - Sharpe ratio

3. Strategy effectiveness evaluation:
   - Is strategy improving over time?
   - Rolling win rate analysis
   - Major pivot recommendations

4. Best practices identification:
   - What produces big winners?
   - Common patterns in success

5. Monthly report to lessons_learned.md
```

## üéØ THE CLOSED LOOP IN ACTION

### Example Timeline:

**Week 1-2:**
```
Day 1-10: System makes trades using initial strategy
          No learning yet (need 5+ completed trades)
```

**Day 11 (First Daily Learning):**
```
Completed trades: 6
Daily Learning runs:
  - Technical Breakouts: 1 win, 2 losses (33% win rate)
  - Status: "Low confidence, need more data"
  - Action: Monitor closely
```

**Day 15 (Daily Learning):**
```
Completed trades: 12
Daily Learning runs:
  - Technical Breakouts: 1 win, 5 losses (17% win rate)
  - Status: "Concerning pattern emerging"
  - Action: Add warning to lessons_learned.md
```

**Day 18 (Daily Learning - CRITICAL):**
```
Completed trades: 18
Daily Learning runs:
  - Technical Breakouts: 2 wins, 8 losses (20% win rate)
  - Confidence: MEDIUM (10 trades)
  - Win rate: 20% (below 35% threshold)
  
  **AUTOMATIC ACTIONS:**
  1. Adds to catalyst_exclusions.json:
     {
       "catalyst": "Technical_Breakout",
       "win_rate": 20.0,
       "total_trades": 10,
       "reason": "Consistently poor performance"
     }
  
  2. Updates strategy_rules.md:
     ## üö´ AUTO-EXCLUDED CATALYSTS
     - Technical Breakouts: 20% win rate (MEDIUM confidence)
  
  3. Logs to lessons_learned.md:
     "Technical Breakouts excluded - poor performance"
```

**Day 19 Morning (Go Command):**
```
Agent loads context:
  - strategy_rules.md shows Technical Breakouts excluded ‚úì
  - catalyst_exclusions.json contains Technical_Breakout ‚úì
  
Agent calls Claude:
  System prompt: "Do not use excluded catalysts"
  Claude sees the exclusions
  
Claude's picks: 10 stocks (NONE are Technical Breakouts) ‚úì

Agent validates:
  - No violations detected ‚úì
  - All picks follow learned rules ‚úì

**THE LOOP IS CLOSED** ‚úì
```
