## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Morning Check-In (8:45 AM):**
   - Claude reviews all 10 current positions
   - Scans for new high-probability opportunities
   - Makes BUY/SELL/HOLD decisions
   - Provides clear action items

2. **The System Learns:**
   - Every trade is documented with thesis and outcome
   - Performance tracked by catalyst type
   - Patterns identified (what works vs. what doesn't)
   - Strategy continuously refined based on data

3. **Statistical Edge Emerges:**
   - Week 1: Gather baseline data
   - Weeks 2-4: Identify patterns
   - Month 2+: High-confidence system with proven edge

## 🎓 Core Strategy

**We ONLY trade stocks with Tier 1 catalysts:**
- ✅ Earnings beats with raised guidance
- ✅ Strong sector momentum
- ✅ Major analyst upgrades
- ✅ Confirmed technical breakouts
- ✅ Binary event winners (FDA, contracts, M&A)

**Risk Management:**
- 10% position size per stock
- -7% stop loss (strictly enforced)
- +10-15% profit targets
- 3-7 day target hold time (max 3 weeks)

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**Month 1:** Learn the system, gather data, expect +0-8% return  
**Month 2:** Refine approach, drop what doesn't work, expect +3-10%  
**Month 3+:** Consistent edge identified, expect +5-12%

**Primary goal is LEARNING, not maximizing returns**

---

## ⚠️ Important

- **Paper trading only** - no real money involved
- **Educational purposes** - not financial advice
- **Simulated results** - don't reflect real trading conditions
- **AI-assisted** - Claude is not a licensed financial professional
- **Risk disclosure** - real trading involves substantial risk of loss
