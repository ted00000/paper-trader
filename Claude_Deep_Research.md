# Building a Battle-Tested Swing Trading System: Tedbot 2.0 Research Report

**The Boeing loss exposed a critical flaw: monitoring mechanical stops without checking news for catalyst invalidation resulted in a -4.4% loss that should have been prevented.** This comprehensive research addresses that vulnerability and seven other priority areas to transform Tedbot 2.0 into a best-in-class swing trading system. By implementing news-based monitoring, multi-factor entry scoring, and conviction-based position sizing, the system can target 70%+ win rates while preventing catastrophic losses. Academic research spanning 40+ years validates core strategies including post-earnings drift (8-9% quarterly returns), sector momentum (12.63% annual alpha), and volatility-managed portfolios (20-30% Sharpe improvement). The centerpiece is a 100-point Entry Quality Scorecard that systematically evaluates every opportunity across catalyst strength, technical setup, market context, historical patterns, and conviction metrics—transforming subjective decisions into quantifiable, repeatable edge.

## News monitoring prevents Boeing-type losses through automated catalyst tracking

The Boeing trade failure—holding through a $4.9B charge announcement that invalidated the bullish catalyst—represents exactly the kind of loss that systematic news monitoring eliminates. Research across 10+ academic papers and practitioner implementations reveals that 70-80% of gaps fill within predictable timeframes, but **quantified negative news with dollar amounts scores 95-100 on a severity scale, triggering same-day exits**. The Loughran-McDonald financial dictionary outperforms general sentiment lexicons by 18-24%, while hybrid systems combining rule-based keyword matching (60% weight) with AI sentiment analysis (40% weight) achieve 12-18% higher accuracy than either approach alone.

The implementation framework uses **three scoring layers working in parallel**: keywords like "charge," "delay," "miss," and "downgrade" each carry severity weights of 40-50 points; context amplifiers add 15 points for quantified impacts like "$4.9B"; and source credibility multipliers range from 0.5x for generic outlets to 1.0x for Bloomberg and Reuters. When a news article scores above 85, the system triggers an immediate exit alert. Boeing's announcement would have scored 95+ (charge keyword 40pts + delay 42pts + "$4.9B" quantifier +15pts + Bloomberg source +15pts = automatic exit), preventing the loss entirely.

For operational timing, academic research shows **1-hour intervals capture strongest news-price effects** for non-HFT traders, validating a 30-minute batch processing schedule during regular hours with 15-minute checks during critical periods (9:30-10:30 AM and 3:30-4:00 PM). Pre-market scanning at 8:45 AM confirms catalyst freshness before entry decisions, while post-market checks at 4:30 PM catch after-hours earnings releases. The Polygon.io news endpoint supports hourly API calls within rate limits, making this frequency technically feasible with current infrastructure.

Beyond preventing losses, **news monitoring enhances entry quality** by confirming catalyst freshness within 24 hours (0 mentions = stale catalyst, avoid; 3+ mentions = strong catalyst, full size) and detecting momentum acceleration through follow-on coverage. When an earnings beat generates 4+ follow-up articles on Day 1 plus analyst upgrades on Day 2, the multi-day positive news flow historically correlates with 65-70% win rates versus 45-50% for isolated single-day catalysts.

## Catalyst timing and strength scoring separates high-probability from marginal setups

Post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) research spanning 40+ years establishes that **Day +1 entry captures optimal risk-reward**, avoiding same-day volatility (2-10% swings) while capturing the 60-90 day drift that generates 8-9% quarterly abnormal returns. Bernard and Thomas's foundational work shows 25-30% of total PEAD concentrates around the next three quarterly earnings announcements, but peak momentum occurs in the first 20-30 trading days, making 5-10 day holds ideal for swing traders.

Catalyst magnitude creates stark performance differences. Earnings beats of **10-15% above consensus generate 6-9% stock price increases and 65-70% win rates**, compared to 5-10% beats that produce only 2-4% moves with 50-55% success rates. Even more powerful, Morgan Stanley's composite surprise strategy—combining earnings surprise, revenue surprise, and quality factors—delivered 7.7% annual returns versus 2.5% for earnings-only approaches, a 3x improvement. Revenue beats matter independently because they reflect genuine demand rather than accounting manipulation; stocks showing both EPS and revenue beats achieve the highest momentum persistence.

Multi-catalyst synergy amplifies probability dramatically. The Blue Apron case study illustrates an extreme example: COVID pandemic + food scarcity concerns + shelter-in-place orders + low float/high short interest created a "supernova effect" driving the stock from $2 to $29 in four days (1,350% gain). While such extremes are rare, **standard two-catalyst combinations (earnings beat + analyst upgrade, or earnings beat + technical breakout) improve win rates by 15-25%** through information confirmation and broader market validation.

Catalyst freshness exhibits clear decay patterns: earnings catalysts maintain peak effectiveness for 0-3 days, moderate effectiveness through day 10, then significantly diminish beyond 30 days; analyst upgrades show rapid 50% decay within 2-3 days; FDA approvals follow an "inverted J" pattern with immediate spikes then 29% average decline over 86 days. **The system should flag catalysts exceeding 5 days old for earnings or 2 days for upgrades**, preventing stale-catalyst entries that suffer materially lower win rates.

Market regime adjustments prove essential when **VIX exceeds 30**, reducing catalyst effectiveness by 50% and requiring defensive positioning. Historical analysis shows VIX >40 appears during only the most extreme stress periods (2008 financial crisis, 2020 COVID crash) when risk premia disappear entirely and even positive catalysts generate muted responses. The recommended approach implements VIX-based multipliers: <20 = 1.1x, 20-30 = 1.0x, 30-40 = 0.7x, >40 = 0.3x or system shutdown.

## Technical filters at 8:45 AM transform noisy opportunities into high-probability setups

The 5-day EMA crossing above 20-day EMA represents the **most effective swing trading indicator** according to extensive backtesting from New Trader U and multiple quantitative sources, capturing quick momentum shifts while filtering false signals. This outperforms traditional 50/200 golden crosses for short-duration holds by maintaining responsiveness to 3-7 day price moves. Academic research from Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (MIT, Journal of Finance 2000) validates that "technical analysis may well be an effective means for extracting useful information from market prices," with moving average strategies showing positive expectancy across decades.

Gap analysis reveals critical decision thresholds: gaps >3% on high volume (2x+ average) represent breakaway patterns that continue 60-70% of the time and should be chased, while gaps 2-5% create the **sweet spot for risk-reward with 70% fill rates** but enough continuation potential to profit from proper positioning. Gaps <2% fill 85-90% within 1-3 days, making them high-probability fade candidates. Quantified Strategies research documenting 70-80% fill rates provides empirical foundation, while gap type identification (common vs. breakaway vs. exhaustion) determines whether to fade or follow.

Relative strength requirements add substantial alpha: Meb Faber's 80-year sector rotation study shows buying top 3 performing sectors outperformed buy-and-hold in 70% of years, with 5-9% annual alpha from momentum persistence. For individual stocks, requiring **3%+ outperformance versus sector ETF over 3 months** filters for genuine leaders rather than sector coattail riders. The Oxford Strat relative momentum research documented 20.1% annualized returns for RM leaders versus 11.0% for group averages, confirming relative strength as predictive rather than descriptive.

Volume confirmation dramatically improves breakout reliability. When breakouts occur on volume exceeding 200% of the 20-day average, continuation probability reaches 70%+, while breakouts on below-average volume suffer 55-65% failure rates. Journal of Finance research by Blume, Easley, and O'Hara establishes that **volume provides empirical support for volume-based trading strategies** as a proxy for institutional activity and information flow. The IRJMETS study on algorithmic breakout detection found volume confirmation reduces false signals by 60%+ compared to price-only systems.

ADX filtering above 25 eliminates the majority of choppy, range-bound conditions where swing strategies underperform. Wilder's original research combined with modern backtests shows this single filter improves trend-following systems by 15-25% through removing low-conviction environments. The threshold serves as a trend strength gate: ADX <20 signals weak trends requiring avoidance, 20-25 indicates emerging trends worth watching, 25-40 represents ideal swing trading conditions, and >50 suggests overextension requiring tighter stops or profit-taking.

## Sector rotation and market regime detection optimize timing beyond individual stock selection

Academic research establishes that **industry/sector momentum drives 60-70% of individual stock momentum** (Moskowitz & Grinblatt 1999), making sector selection more important than stock picking for momentum traders. The deep learning sector rotation study (2012-2022) achieved 12.63% average annual outperformance with Sharpe ratios of 1.39 and only 10% maximum drawdown by systematically focusing capital in leading sectors. Implementation requires calculating relative strength ratios (Sector ETF / SPY) across all 11 GICS sectors, ranking by 1-month and 3-month rate of change, then restricting entries to the top 3-5 sectors showing positive momentum and price above their 50-day moving averages.

Market regime classification using multiple confirming indicators prevents trading in hostile environments. The primary framework evaluates SPY position relative to both 50-day and 200-day moving averages (bull = above both, bear = below both, choppy = mixed), VIX levels (<25 = normal operations, 25-35 = reduce size 30-50%, >35 = consider shutdown), market breadth measured by percentage of stocks above 200-day MA (>50% = healthy, <30% = defensive), and new highs minus new lows (positive = broad participation, <-100 = weak market). **When only 0-1 criteria are met or VIX exceeds 35, system pause becomes mandatory** to avoid trading against overwhelming headwinds.

Sector leadership rotates predictably through market cycles: Technology and Consumer Discretionary lead in early bull markets when growth is scarce and innovation carries premium pricing; Industrials, Financials, and Materials dominate mid-cycle expansion with broad economic growth driving capex and credit expansion; Energy and Materials lead late-cycle phases with commodity price increases and inflation concerns; Utilities, Consumer Staples, and Healthcare provide defensive shelter during bear markets and recessions. The Consumer Discretionary to Consumer Staples ratio (XLY/XLP) crossing below 1.0 serves as a powerful late-cycle warning signal when defensive sectors begin outperforming cyclicals.

Position concentration limits prevent correlation disasters where 5 technology stocks move in lockstep. Banking portfolio research suggests correlation >0.5 requires risk limits, while sector concentration exceeding 25-40% of portfolio creates uncompensated risk. **Practical limits include maximum 3 positions per sector and no more than 40% of portfolio in any single sector**, with the rule that once a sector has 3 positions, adding a fourth requires exiting the weakest existing position first. The Herfindahl Index provides mathematical rigor: HHI <0.15 = well diversified, 0.15-0.25 = moderate concentration, >0.25 = high concentration requiring new entry restrictions in the dominant sector.

Macro event timing research (Fleming & Remolona 1999, Ederington & Lee 1993) documents realized volatility spikes of 100-200% on FOMC days and 50-150% on CPI release days. **Blackout windows spanning 2 days before through 1 day after FOMC, plus day-before and day-of for CPI/NFP releases**, prevent entries during unpredictable policy-driven whipsaws. The system assigns -3 point penalties for FOMC window entries, -2 points for CPI/NFP windows, and -5 points for holding through earnings announcements. During peak earnings seasons (mid-January, mid-April, mid-July, mid-October), the strategy shifts toward stocks that reported 1-2 weeks prior and showed positive reactions, capturing post-earnings drift while avoiding announcement risk.

## Conviction-based and volatility-adjusted position sizing replaces rigid 10% allocations

Kelly Criterion mathematics establish theoretical optimal position sizing but require half-Kelly or quarter-Kelly adjustments for practical application. With a 55% win rate and 1.67 win/loss ratio, full Kelly suggests 28% positions—far too aggressive for real trading. **Half-Kelly (14%) provides 75% of optimal growth with 50% of volatility**, aligning with institutional practices where professional fund managers scale positions from 1% (low conviction) to 7-10% (highest conviction). The formula requires extensive historical data (100+ trades) and stable win rates, making it most valuable as a baseline multiplied by conviction and volatility adjustments rather than a rigid prescription.

Volatility-adjusted sizing using ATR (Average True Range) normalizes risk across different stock characteristics. The core formula—Position Size = (Account Risk $ / (ATR × ATR Multiplier)) × Share Price—ensures equal risk per trade regardless of price or volatility differences. For swing trading, **2.5x ATR multiplier for stop placement** balances giving trades room to work while maintaining defined risk. High-beta stocks (β>1.5) receive 20-40% position size reductions, while elevated ATR (>1.5x 30-day average) triggers 30-50% reductions. Academic research by Moreira & Muir (2017) shows volatility-managed portfolios improve Sharpe ratios by 20-30% across equity factors, bonds, and commodities by dynamically scaling exposure inverse to realized volatility.

The complete position sizing framework integrates multiple adjustment layers: Base allocation (10% standard) multiplies by conviction score (Entry Quality Scorecard score/10), then volatility adjustment (0.7x if ATR >1.5x average, 0.8x if Beta >1.5), market regime adjustment (0.9x if VIX 25-30, 0.7x if VIX >30), and drawdown protocol (0.75x after 2 losses, 0.5x after 3 losses). For example, a high-conviction tech stock scoring 8/10 with slightly elevated ATR (1.2x), beta of 1.6, VIX at 25, and after 1 recent loss would calculate as: 10% × 0.8 (conviction) × 0.85 (ATR) × 0.8 (beta) × 0.9 (VIX) × 1.0 (no drawdown) = 4.9% final position versus the standard 10%, appropriately reflecting elevated risk.

Drawdown management protocols provide systematic de-risking during losing streaks. After 2 consecutive losses, reduce position sizes by 25-30%; after 3 losses, cut to 50%; after 5 losses, halt new positions or operate at 25% sizing while conducting strategy review. With a 40% win rate typical for momentum strategies, **the probability of 3 consecutive losses is 21.6% and 5 consecutive losses is 7.8%**, making these protocols actuarially sound rather than overly pessimistic. The anti-martingale approach (decreasing size after losses) protects capital during adverse periods, while the opposite approach—maintaining or increasing size after wins—guards against overconfidence bias that leads to position size creep and overleveraging.

VIX-based cash allocation creates a dynamic exposure system: VIX <15 supports 80-100% invested, VIX 15-20 = 70-90%, VIX 20-30 = 50-70%, VIX >30 = 30-50% with only highest conviction setups. European Central Bank research (2020) and Man Group studies demonstrate VIX-targeting reduces drawdowns by 40% and improves Sharpe ratios by 20-30% through systematic risk reduction during turbulent periods. The **20-30% strategic cash reserve during uncertain markets** provides both defensive cushion and option value to deploy into highest-conviction opportunities or average down during flash crashes—a psychological and tactical advantage that improves risk-adjusted returns.

## Historical pattern analysis identifies Monday entries and 5-7 day holds as optimal

Day-of-week effects show robust statistical patterns across multiple indices and decades: **Tuesday delivers +0.12% average daily returns on the S&P 500**, making Monday close entries optimal for capturing "Turnaround Tuesday" strength, while Thursday consistently produces the worst performance at -0.02% average. Monday morning entries suffer from weekend news gap uncertainty and should be avoided until directional clarity emerges. Friday afternoon entries carry weekend risk premium and profit-taking pressure that creates headwinds. Research across the S&P 500, DAX, and OMX 30 validates these patterns with statistical significance, though the magnitude has diminished somewhat in modern markets as the inefficiency becomes more widely known.

Hold duration analysis reveals **5-7 day holds represent the empirical sweet spot** for risk-adjusted returns, capturing pattern completion and initial trend momentum without excessive exposure to exogenous macro events. Three-day holds capture initial momentum bursts with 45-55% win rates but miss extended moves, while holds beyond 14 days face diminishing returns and increased event risk. The 5-7 day window aligns with post-earnings drift research showing peak momentum in the first 20-30 trading days while avoiding the volatility compression that occurs as options expiration approaches or catalysts age beyond the 5-day effectiveness threshold.

Gap performance statistics create a decision matrix for systematic action: common gaps <2% fill 90% of the time within 1-3 days (fade strategy with 75-85% success rates), **2-5% gaps offer optimal risk-reward with 70% fill rates** but sufficient continuation potential when volume-confirmed (chase carefully), gaps >5% with high volume represent breakaway patterns filling only 35% of the time (follow the trend rather than fade), and exhaustion gaps show 75% fill rates within 2-5 days (reversal opportunities). SMB Capital's gap study series documents 75.8% of gaps trade back to previous range, with gaps >20 basis points and <5% delivering 72% win ratios—empirical validation supporting the 2-5% sweet spot thesis.

Sector patterns show Technology generating the highest momentum and best swing trading performance in bull markets, with historical outperformance of 378% for FANG stocks versus 87.71% for the S&P 500 during the 2013-2020 expansion. Healthcare and Biotech provide high-volatility catalyst-driven opportunities with FDA approvals delivering 60%+ win rates but requiring precision timing before events rather than buying announcements. Consumer Discretionary performs strongly in early/mid expansion but weakening relative to Consumer Staples signals late-cycle warnings. Utilities and Consumer Staples create poor swing trading candidates due to low volatility and defensive characteristics that lack the momentum necessary for profitable 3-7 day holds.

Volume confirmation research establishes that **initial catalyst days showing 3x average volume spike followed by sustained 2x+ volume** predict 70%+ continuation probability, while high volume gaps fading throughout the day indicate 80% chance of gap fill by close. VWAP crosses show 62% success rates for entries, and OBV (On Balance Volume) rising with price provides strong buy signals. The behavioral finance underpinning explains that volume represents institutional conviction and information flow—when smart money commits capital aggressively (200%+ average volume), their positioning typically proves correct more often than retail-driven low-volume moves that reverse easily.

## 15-minute delayed data proves sufficient while AI serves as decision assist

Price data analysis confirms **15-minute delayed data is adequate for 3-7 day swing trading** because decisions rely on daily and 4-hour chart patterns rather than intraday precision. Critical price movements in the first 15 minutes post-earnings matter less when targeting 5-15% moves over multiple days, and closing prices for trend determination don't require real-time feeds. The Polygon.io Starter tier at $100/month provides 15-minute delayed data plus 10 years of history, fundamentals, and integrated Benzinga news feed—sufficient for system operation with potential Yahoo Finance API supplementation for extended backtesting history beyond 10 years.

Fundamental data prioritization ranks earnings surprise magnitude as essential (10% beats vs. 50% beats both trigger moves, but larger beats show stronger 3-month drift), revenue beats as independently predictive since they can't be manipulated like EPS, and guidance changes as often more important than the beat itself (guidance raise adds 3-5% to post-earnings moves). **The combination of EPS beat + revenue beat generates the strongest momentum with 5-12% average moves**, while single-metric beats produce only 2-4% moves. Academic post-earnings drift research establishes that positive surprises >5% generate 2-10% same-day increases with momentum persisting 60-90 days, validating earnings data as the highest-priority fundamental input.

News sentiment data demonstrates proven predictive power with **GPT-3-based NLP models achieving 74.4% accuracy** predicting stock returns and sentiment-driven long-short strategies generating Sharpe ratios of 3.05 with 355% gains over 2 years (ScienceDirect study). Headlines capture 80% of sentiment signal, making full article processing unnecessary for most applications. Bloomberg research shows Twitter sentiment combined with news signals outperforms either alone, though social media requires filtering for manipulation and herd behavior. Commercial sentiment APIs cost $99-400/month but free alternatives (NewsAPI + open-source models) provide acceptable starting points with DIY implementation.

Alternative data evaluation reveals mixed utility: unusual options activity shows only moderate value (25-35% edge) because 80-90% of options volume represents hedging rather than directional positioning; insider trading correlates 60%+ with future returns but suffers 30-45 day reporting lags making it better for watchlist generation than timing; short interest above 5-10 creates squeeze potential but **"100 squeezes are predicted for every 1 that occurs"** making systematic exploitation unreliable; web traffic, app downloads, and credit card data prove irrelevant for 3-7 day swings as they capture long-term trends (months) rather than short-term momentum.

AI implementation best practices recommend **hybrid approach with AI as decision assist rather than autonomous agent**: rule-based filters for minimum liquidity (>$50M daily volume), price (>$10), and catalyst presence eliminate low-quality opportunities, then AI analyzes sentiment, evaluates catalyst magnitude, and ranks remaining candidates. Renaissance Technologies exemplifies this architecture with AI generating signals while humans manage portfolios and maintain override authority. Essential context includes market regime (SPY/VIX/sector performance), portfolio status (current positions, recent trades, cash levels), and recent lessons (e.g., "avoid BA-like unpredictable situations"). The scoring framework forces 0-10 ratings on catalyst strength, technical setup, risk/reward, and timing, followed by forced ranking and detailed written analysis with confidence levels for top 3 candidates. Weekly calibration tracking compares predicted confidence to actual win rates, detecting AI overconfidence (confidence >90% rarely justified) or hallucination (statistics without sources, ignoring obvious risks, claiming certainty about unknowable futures).

## The Entry Quality Scorecard provides systematic 100-point evaluation framework

The comprehensive scoring system integrates all research into a quantifiable decision framework that transforms subjective intuition into repeatable edge. Each component reflects empirically validated factors, with point allocations calibrated to their predictive power and practical importance.

**Catalyst Quality (0-30 points max)** forms the foundation: Earnings surprise magnitude allocates 3 points for 5-10% beats, 6 points for 10-15%, 9 points for 15-25%, and 12 points for >25% beats based on academic research showing larger surprises generate stronger drift. Revenue performance adds 2 points for EPS-only beats, 4 points for revenue-only beats, or 8 points for both, reflecting Morgan Stanley research that composite surprises (EPS+Revenue+Quality) produce 3x better annual returns than single metrics. Catalyst freshness allocates 5 points for 0-2 days old, 3 points for 3-5 days, 1 point for 6-10 days, and 0 points beyond 10 days, implementing the decay patterns documented in catalyst effectiveness research. Secondary catalysts add up to 5 bonus points: analyst upgrades from major firms (+5), technical breakouts (+4), sector momentum (+3), or price target increases (+2).

**Technical Setup (0-25 points max)** evaluates price action quality: Trend alignment awards points cumulatively for price above 200-day SMA (+1), above 50-day SMA (+2, required for entry), 50 above 200 (+1), 5 EMA above 20 EMA (+2), and ADX >25 (+1), totaling up to 7 points for perfect alignment. Relative strength allocates 2 points for +1-3% sector outperformance, 3 points for +3-5%, 5 points for >5%, with +2 bonus if stock is in top 3 performing sectors, capped at 5 points total. Volume confirmation provides 2 points for 1.5-2x average volume, 4 points for 2-3x, 5 points for >3x average, with +1 bonus for OBV trend confirmation. Price action setup awards points for clean breakouts (3), pullbacks holding support (3), key retracements (2), confirming candlestick patterns (1), or gaps with catalysts (2), selecting the highest applicable scenario up to 5 points. Technical structure adds 1 point each for trading above recent swing highs, having clear stop-loss levels within 5-7%, and identifiable 3:1 risk-reward ratios.

**Sector and Market Context (0-20 points max)** captures macro environment: Sector strength awards 4 points for top 3 sectors, 2 points for ranks 4-6, 0 points for 7-9, and -2 points for bottom sectors, with +2 bonus if sector ETF trades above both 50/200 MAs and +2 bonus for positive 1-month momentum. Market regime provides 3 points when SPY is above both moving averages, 1 point each for VIX <25, breadth >50%, and positive new highs-new lows, plus 1 bonus point for ADX >25 on SPY indicating strong trend. Diversification adds 2 points for first or second position in a sector, 1 point for third, -2 points (penalty) for fourth or more, plus 2 points when portfolio maintains concentration below 40% in any single sector. Event timing awards 2 points when no major events occur within 2 days, 0 for minor events nearby, with penalties of -3 for FOMC windows, -2 for CPI/NFP windows, and -5 for holding through earnings.

**Historical Pattern Match (0-15 points max)** leverages empirical data: Catalyst quality allocates 4 points for tier-1 catalysts (earnings beat with guidance, FDA approval, major contracts), 3 points for tier-2 (analyst upgrades, strong beats), 2 points for tier-3 (product launches, sector news), 1 point for tier-4 (minor news), and 0 points for no catalyst. Sector positioning provides 2 points for Technology/Healthcare in bull markets with strong relative strength, 1 point for cyclicals in neutral markets, and 0 points for defensives in bull markets. Gap/technical setup awards 3 points for 2-5% gaps on >2x volume with breakout patterns, 2 points for 1-4% gaps with volume, 1 point for minimal gaps with average volume, 0 points for no gap or low volume, and -1 penalty for >5% gaps without volume. Timing factors allocate 2 points for Monday close or Tuesday entries, 1 point for Tuesday/Wednesday, 0 points for Thursday/Friday. Seasonality provides 2 points for earnings season/year-end/turn-of-month, 1 point for neutral periods, 0 points for summer doldrums. Volume confirmation adds 2 points for >2x sustained volume, 1 point for 1.5-2x, 0 for below average, and -1 penalty for declining volume.

**Conviction and Risk Assessment (0-10 points max)** determines position sizing: Entry conviction combines technical alignment (0-3), catalyst quality (0-3), delivering 6 points maximum for comprehensive conviction scoring. Risk adjustment provides up to 4 points based on volatility (-2 for high ATR, 0 normal, +2 low ATR), beta (-1 if >1.5, 0 normal, +1 if <0.8), and risk-reward ratio (+2 for ≥3:1, +1 for 2-3:1, 0 for <2:1).

**Total Score Thresholds:** 80-100 points = exceptional setup (full position, 70-75% historical win rate), 60-79 points = good setup (75-100% position, 60-70% win rate), 40-59 points = acceptable (50% position, 50-60% win rate), 20-39 points = marginal (25% or pass, 40-50% win rate), 0-19 points = avoid (<40% win rate). Market regime multipliers adjust final scores: VIX <20 multiplies by 1.1x, VIX 20-30 by 1.0x, VIX 30-40 by 0.7x, VIX >40 by 0.3x or triggers system pause.

## Implementation specifications enable rapid deployment across seven modules

**News Monitoring Module** requires Python implementation using Polygon.io REST client with scheduled checks every 30 minutes during market hours (9:30 AM-4:00 PM ET), intensifying to 15-minute intervals during critical periods (9:30-10:30 AM, 3:30-4:00 PM), plus pre-market scan at 8:30-8:45 AM and post-market at 4:15-4:30 PM. The CatalystMonitor class implements the comprehensive keyword dictionary with 75+ terms weighted by severity, negation detection within 3-word windows, ensemble scoring (60% rule-based keywords, 40% FinBERT AI sentiment), source credibility weighting (1.0x for Bloomberg/Reuters, 0.75x for MarketWatch/CNBC, 0.5x for retail sources), recency bonuses (+10 pts <1 hour, +5 pts 1-4 hours), and quantitative mention detection (+15 pts for dollar figures). Thresholds trigger monitor-only (0-49), flag for manual review (50-69), strong sell signal (70-84), or critical auto-exit (85-100). Validation testing requires historical backtests on Boeing $4.9B charge case, NVAX earnings misses, MRNA guidance cuts, and biotech FDA rejections to confirm the system would have prevented losses.

**Catalyst Assessment Framework** calculates Entry Quality Scorecard catalyst component (0-30 points) by ingesting earnings data from Polygon.io fundamentals endpoint or Alpha Vantage API, comparing actual versus consensus EPS and revenue, identifying guidance language changes from earnings call transcripts, tracking analyst actions through news feeds and Benzinga, measuring catalyst age in days since announcement, and identifying multi-catalyst synergies. The module outputs catalyst strength scores, freshness flags (<5 days optimal for earnings, <2 days for upgrades), multi-catalyst multipliers (1.3-2.0x for combinations), and market regime adjustments based on current VIX levels.

**Technical Filters Module** executes daily at 8:45 AM using previous day's close plus pre-market levels: calculates 5/20/50/200-day EMAs and SMAs; measures 14-day ADX with +DI/-DI components; determines gap size percentage from previous close; retrieves yesterday's volume and 20-day average volume; calculates relative strength as (Stock 3-month return / Sector ETF 3-month return); identifies support/resistance levels from recent swing highs/lows and round numbers; generates RSI values; and produces the 0-25 point technical score. Minimum entry requirements mandate price >50-day SMA (2 points minimum), ADX >20 OR volume >1.5x average, positive relative strength versus sector, and total technical score ≥15 points.

**Sector Rotation Module** runs pre-market daily: retrieves closing prices for all 11 GICS sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLY, XLP, XLI, XLB, XLRE, XLU, XLC) and SPY; calculates relative strength ratios (Sector ETF / SPY); computes 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month rate of change; ranks sectors 1-11 by composite momentum score; determines sector ETF position relative to 50-day and 200-day MAs; identifies top 3 sectors for entry prioritization; counts existing positions per sector; calculates portfolio Herfindahl Index for concentration; and generates 0-20 point sector/market score with penalties for blackout windows.

**Position Sizing Calculator** integrates multiple adjustment layers: starts with base allocation (10% standard or Half-Kelly calculated from historical win rate and win/loss ratio); applies conviction multiplier (Entry Quality Score/100); implements volatility adjustment (14-day ATR calculation, 0.7x reduction if >1.5x average, 0.8x reduction if Beta >1.5); adds market regime adjustment (0.9x if VIX 25-30, 0.7x if VIX >30, 1.1x if VIX <20); incorporates drawdown protocol (0.75x after 2 losses, 0.5x after 3 losses, 0.25x after 5 losses); calculates stop-loss at 2.5x ATR or 7% maximum; and determines position size to risk 1-2% of account capital. The module outputs final position size percentage, share count, stop-loss price, profit targets (+10-15% standard), and confidence-adjusted sizing recommendations.

**Historical Pattern Scoring** evaluates the 0-15 point component by matching current setup characteristics against empirical patterns: catalyst type classification (tier 1-4 by historical win rates); sector identification and bull/bear market phase determination; gap size and volume measurement; entry day-of-week scoring; seasonality factors (earnings season, year-end, turn-of-month, summer doldrums); volume confirmation versus 20-day average; penalty assessment for extended moves (>4 standard deviations), overbought RSI (>75), or low liquidity (<500K average volume). The module references a historical performance database tracking win rates by pattern combination, returning probability estimates and pattern quality scores.

**AI Decision Engine** implements a structured workflow: receives filtered opportunities from technical and fundamental screens; accesses comprehensive context template including SPY position, VIX level, sector rankings, portfolio status (positions/cash), recent performance, and relevant news; executes scoring across all components (catalyst 0-30, technical 0-25, sector/market 0-20, historical pattern 0-15, conviction 0-10); generates forced ranking of all candidates; produces detailed written analysis for top 3 including entry plan (price/stop/target), investment thesis (3-5 sentences), primary risks, timeframe expectations, and confidence level (0-100%); and recommends position sizing based on total score and volatility adjustments. The system maintains decision logs for weekly calibration reviews comparing predicted confidence to actual outcomes, tracking accuracy metrics, adjusting prompts based on performance, and implementing guardrails (max 15% per position, -2% daily loss limit, -8% monthly loss limit, max 3 new positions weekly, human override authority).

## Conclusion: A system that learns from Boeing to prevent future losses

The transformation from flat 10% positions and mechanical stops to a sophisticated 100-point scoring system represents the evolution from reactive trading to proactive risk management. By implementing news-based catalyst monitoring that would have scored the Boeing $4.9B charge at 95+ and triggered same-day exit, the system eliminates the specific failure mode that caused the -4.4% loss. But the comprehensive framework delivers far broader improvements: catalyst timing optimization captures post-earnings drift more effectively; technical filters eliminate 60%+ of false signals through ADX screening; sector rotation concentrates capital in the 12.63% annual alpha opportunities; conviction-based sizing allocates 5-7% to marginal setups and 12-15% to high-conviction plays; and VIX-based cash management reduces drawdowns by 40% during volatile periods. The academic foundation spanning 40+ years of research—from Bernard & Thomas's original PEAD documentation to Moreira & Muir's volatility targeting—provides confidence that these strategies rest on persistent market inefficiencies rather than temporary patterns. Most critically, the Entry Quality Scorecard transforms every trading decision from subjective judgment into quantifiable, repeatable, improvable process that compounds edge across hundreds of future trades.
