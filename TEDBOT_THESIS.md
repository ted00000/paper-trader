# Tedbot 2.0: AI-Powered Self-Learning Trading System

**Watch an AI teach itself to tradeâ€”in real time.**

---

## What Is This?

Tedbot 2.0 is an autonomous trading system that uses artificial intelligence to make stock trading decisions, track every outcome, and continuously improve its strategy based on what actually works.

**The Simple Version:**  
Most traders repeat the same mistakes forever. Tedbot learns from every trade and automatically stops using patterns that lose money.

---

## How It Works

### The Concept

The system follows a three-step cycle:

1. **Make Trades** - AI analyzes markets and selects high-probability opportunities
2. **Track Results** - Every trade is logged with detailed performance metrics
3. **Learn & Adapt** - Statistical analysis identifies what works, automatically removes what doesn't

**The key difference from traditional trading:** The learning loop is closed. Insights from past trades directly influence future decisionsâ€”automatically, no human intervention required.

## The Strategy (High Level)

**What We Trade:**  
Only stocks with proven catalysts for short-term price movement:
- Major earnings beats
- Strong sector momentum
- Institutional upgrades
- Confirmed breakouts
- Binary event winners

**Risk Management:**
- 10 positions at a time
- Strict stop losses (-7%)
- Target hold time: 3-7 days
- Maximum position size: 10% of capital

**The Learning System:**  
Multi-tier analysis continuously identifies winning patterns and eliminates losing ones. The system gets smarter every week.

## Why This Matters

### The Problem with Traditional Trading

Most traders fail because they:
- Make emotional decisions
- Repeat mistakes without systematic feedback
- Use strategies that worked once but stopped working
- Never know why they win or lose

### The Tedbot Solution

- **Removes Emotion** - Decisions based on data, not feelings
- **Learns from Mistakes** - Bad patterns get automatically excluded
- **Adapts to Markets** - Strategy evolves as conditions change
- **Transparent Results** - Every trade tracked and visible
