## THE CLOSED LOOP

```
Day 1-10: Collect data (CSV populates)
         ↓
Day 11+:  Daily learning analyzes CSV
         ↓
         Identifies losers (<35% win rate)
         ↓
         Adds to catalyst_exclusions.json
         ↓
         Updates strategy_rules.md
         ↓
Next AM:  Agent loads updated rules
         ↓
         Claude sees exclusions
         ↓
         Picks only good catalysts
         ↓
         **LEARNING AFFECTS TRADES** ✓
